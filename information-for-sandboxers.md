# Information for Sandboxers

Hi, it's me, Adam Harris! Diaryx is my passion project, but I see huge growth in its future. I want to turn it into a powerful, meaningful startup. But I can't do it without you!

I'm applying to Sandbox with Diaryx as my project. The idea for Diaryx developed slowly throughout my life, and started solidifying for the better part of a year. I am the sole developer of Diaryx, and I've been working on this particular iteration for the better part of a year.

I have the benefit of lots of technical expertise and experience. If you don't know how to code, that is totally fine! But there are some qualities you ought to have if you would like to join:

### 1. **You resonate with the vision.**

This is most important. Diaryx is meant to be a meaningful project. I want to feel the Spirit as we work on it. You need to be willing to sacrifice to see this startup succeed. Of course, Diaryx may experience major pivots as we go through the fire of the Sandbox program. I know that possibility seems counterintuitive to the idea of "meaningful work." You just need to recognize that meaningful work is bigger than a program or a way to make money.

### 2. **You work well with me.**

Meet up with me in person and see if we work well together! Ideally, I think I would be able to work with any well-meaning and hardworking person. But Sandbox is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and both of us deserve to work with someone we enjoy working with. So [message me on Slack](https://sandboxapplicants.slack.com/team/U08DRBSRWGY) or [email me](mailto:adam@diaryx.org) to arrange a meetup!

### 3. **You are willing to work hard (and have a healthy work-life balance).**

If you are considering Sandbox, you are probably willing to work hard. I'll just say it this way: 25 hours a week is rookie numbers.


## Nice to have (not required)

- Passionate about digital journaling/family history
- Technical knowledge of Rust, Typescript, Svelte, WebAssembly (or knows how to wrangle an AI agent real good)
- Product management/marketing/design skills (would be quite helpful because they are not my area of expertise)

## So, what are you waiting for?

Let's make this happen! The Hackathon is right around the corner!
