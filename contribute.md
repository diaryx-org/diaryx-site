# Contribute to Diaryx

Thank you for your interest in Diaryx!

The Diaryx team is applying to Sandbox: a year-long startup accelerator at Brigham Young University. If you are at BYU or nearby and wish to join the Diaryx Sandbox team as a founder, please email Adam at [adam@diaryx.org](mailto:adam@diaryx.org)!

If you wish to support Diaryx in other ways, thank you! We are working on setting up finances. In a few weeks, you will be able to support Diaryx by subscribing to a paid plan, which will offer you cloud storage, sync, and website publish functionality in return for your generous support.

In the meanwhile, please email us at [contact@diaryx.org](mailto:contact@diaryx.org) if you can offer help or feedback of any kind.
