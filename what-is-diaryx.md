# What is Diaryx?

Diaryx is writing software designed with a unique philosophy: to be a digital "brass plates".

"Brass plates" refers to an ancient record passed down through generations in the ancient Americas. It enabled people across generations to remember their family history and maintain a consistent identity across generations.

> And these plates of brass, which contain these engravings, which have the records of the holy scriptures upon them, which have the genealogy of our forefathers, even from the beginning...
> They have enlarged the memory of this people, yea, and convinced many of the error of their ways, and brought them to the knowledge of their God unto the salvation of their souls.^[1]

Journaling in any capacity is associated with a large array of benefits, including better mental health and improved interpersonal and relational awareness. Gratitude journaling is even associated with measurable benefits to physical health.

But many people are prevented from enjoying the benefits of journaling. It isn't easy to write---notifications and daily prompts can only go so far. Diaryx seeks to address the concerns people have with digital journaling at its root by combines modern technology with the "brass plates" philosophy: make the writing durable, portable, and long-lasting, without sacrificing digital conveniences.

In order to accomplish this, Diaryx uses a special *writing format* and a set of tools built around it.

Here is an example of the Diaryx Writing Format:

```
---
title: Your entry
author: Your name
audience:
  - Your friends
  - Your family
---

# My journal entry

Today was a good day...

```

The idea is simple: at the top of the document, write its name, its author, its intended audience, and whatever other information about it you like.

You don't need any special tools to do this. In fact, it is good practice, similar to addressing an envelope before you write it. It even helps prevent writer's block by giving you clarity about what you are writing and why.

These important bits of information— title, author, audience, and others— are called **properties**. Diaryx standardizes these and many other properties into a single format, which is universally importable/exportable to any imaginable format.

## What we're building

But Diaryx is more than just a format. We're building **tools that turn your information into actionable reality.**

What if, when you write "audience: family" at the top of your document, the app actually made sure that your family got to read what you wrote? And you could add other labels: "friends," "coworkers," "church group," "class of '08", or whatever else, and the app could share it with all of them?

The [Diaryx app](https://app.diaryx.org) already supports audience filtering. You can start a "live share" session and filter your private writing so your friend sees the right files.

-Although it sounds simple enough, no other tool can do this. The closest alternative is managing a list of emails while praying your platform doesn't shut down or lock you in.

Our roadmap includes plans for more import/export formats, notifications for audience groups, and extension functionality. With a simple declarative format, the possibilities are endless. You have ultimate control over

## Where we addressing
